## Minimum Viable Product

- [ ] Plan and implement how you are going to manage your state for your application
- [ ] You _must_ use either context or Redux as your state management system
- [ ] Once you have planned out your state management system, fetch data from the smurf server and display the data it returns
- [ ] Add a form to collect info for a new smurf, and make a POST request to the server to add a new smurf to your village

## API documentation

### GET '/smurfs'

- [ ] Retrieve an array all the Smurfs in the Smurf DB by writing a `GET` to the endpoint `/smurfs`.
- [ ] Double check that your response from the server is an array of smurfs.

```js
[
  {
    name: "Brainey",
    age: 200,
    height: "5cm",
    id: 0
  }
];
```

### POST '/smurfs'

- [ ] Design the functionality to add a smurf to the Smurf DB you'll need all three fields. `name`, `age`, and `height`.

Example of the shape of data to be sent to the `POST` endpoint:

```js
{
  name: 'Brainey',
  age: 200,
  height: '5cm'
}
```

- [ ] Double check to make sure that a smurf is created correctly once your functionality is built out.

Initially Brainey will be in the array, but it takes more than one smurf to make the village. Be sure to add a few smurfs to populate our smurf village.

**HINT** if you are going to be working on Stretch Problem, you'll need to use that unique `id`.

Example of object created in Smurf DB:

```js
[
  {
    name: "Brainey",
    age: 200,
    height: "5cm",
    id: 0
  },
  {
    name: "Sleepy",
    age: 200,
    height: "5cm",
    id: 1
  }
];
```

## STRETCH PROBLEM

The following two endpoints are here for you if you'd like to push yourselves a little further.

### PUT '/smurfs/123', where 123 is the Id of the smurf you want to modify

- [ ] For this endpoint to work, you'll need an `id` added to the URL, and at least one field to update on the Smurf object. `name` `age` `height`.

Example:

```js
input:
{
  id: 1,
  name: 'Grumpy'
}
output:
[
  {
    name: 'Grumpy',
    age: 30,
    height: '3cm',
    id: 1
  },
  {
    name: 'Sleepy',
    age: 211,
    height: '2cm',
    id: 0
  }
]
```

### DELETE '/smurfs/123', where 123 is the Id of the smurf you want to remove

For this endpoint to work, all you need is an id sent up as part of the request url.

If your delete worked, you'll get a an array back with all of the smurfs but with your requested smurf removed.

- [ ] You don't need any input beyond the url parameter of the smurf, so if we send up a delete request to `/smurfs/123` then you'll remove the smurf by that id.

Example:

```js
output: [
  {
    name: "Sleepy",
    age: 200,
    height: "5cm",
    id: 1
  }
];
```
